- ~~Image on site gets too narrow/shrinks weridly when browser window is shrunk~~
- maybe move prompts and alerts into a "quiz" function? (but it needs to return the answers) - CHECK BACK LATER
- ~~move percentage calculation into a separate function~~
- ~~move box styling into separate function~~
- ~~move result array into a separate function, pass fn, ln, roundedpercent => results~~
- ~~can maybe get rid of for loop, replace with a call to getResultString() (which needs to be written); each switch statement case would be a call to getResultString~~
~~secretBox.textContent = getResultString(firstName, lastName, roundedPercent)~~
